# Evil Battleship ‚Äî TENS Shock Edition (EiE Devboard)

**Final project** from the *Embedded in Embedded* group (University of Calgary) by **Django Schmidt** & **Chase Mackenzie**. Built over ~2 months on the EiE custom devboard. When your ship gets hit‚Ä¶ you get zapped via a TENS unit driven by a relay. ‚ö°

> **What is the EiE devboard?**  
> A custom embedded system with foundational libraries by the EiE & Garmin team. It provides a **dot-matrix display**, **LEDs**, **buzzer**, **ANT (wireless) communication**, **buttons**, and **3.3 V toggleable output pins**.

## Features

- Short-form **Battleship‚Ñ¢** adapted for the EiE devboard
- **Attention-grabbing design twist:** TENS shock on *hit* ‚ö°
- Uses multiple board peripherals: dot-matrix, LEDs, buzzer, buttons, ANT radio
- Simple state-machine architecture for clear game flow
- Two supported build targets:
  - `ASCII` (terminal simulation)
  - `DOT_MATRIX` (on-board dot-matrix display)

Additional notes to include:
- This project uses a **TENS unit** to shock the user when a battleship is hit.
- On the devboard we **soldered a relay + transistor** to switch the TENS unit.

## Hardware Hookups

- **TENS unit output** is gated by a **relay** driven through a **transistor** from a 3.3 V GPIO.
- Ensure the relay coil voltage and driver transistor (with base/gate resistor) match the board‚Äôs capabilities.
- Add a **flyback diode** across the relay coil if required by your relay spec.

> **Note:** Choose low-current relays compatible with the EiE board‚Äôs drive or add a proper driver stage.

## Safety First ‚ö†Ô∏è

> **WARNING:** TENS devices deliver electrical stimulation and can be dangerous if misused.  
> - Do **not** use on anyone with implanted electronic devices (e.g., pacemakers) or known contraindications.  
> - Keep current paths away from the chest/heart and head.  
> - Use **lowest** intensity for demos.  
> - Obtain consent and provide a no-shock opt-out mode.  
> - This repository is for educational purposes; you assume all responsibility.

## Build & Flash (Waf)

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Configure once (choose ONE of the boards)
./waf configure --board=ASCII
# or
./waf configure --board=DOT_MATRIX

# 2) Build
./waf build

# 3) Build & flash (if flashing is supported on your setup)
./waf build -F
```

**Command reference:**
```bash
python waf -?
python waf configure --board=ASCII
python waf configure --board=DOT_MATRIX
python waf build
python waf build -F
```

> If configuration succeeds, you typically only need to run it once per board type.

## How It Works

- **State machine** manages game phases:
  1. **Init/Setup** ‚Üí hardware init, seed RNG, place ships  
  2. **Pair/Comm** (ANT) ‚Üí exchange moves (or simulate for single-board)  
  3. **Turn Loop** ‚Üí input, validate, update board, render  
  4. **Hit Event** ‚Üí LEDs/buzzer feedback + **relay toggles TENS**  
  5. **Win/Lose** ‚Üí summary screen / reset
